# Soon to be Deprecated and Replaced
This repo and version of AutoLab is soon to be deprecated. The current version (3.1.0) works as described under the original releases of Win10 and Server 2016.  Due to the major update versions from Microsoft and changes to Hyper-V over the past year, you may have issues getting this to work as described. Check the “Issues” list for possible solutions.

We are currently working on a new product with similar functionality that will be published to a new repo. 

## When the new product is ready for release, we will post a link here. We are planning Q1 of 2018.

Until then, this repo and product is soon to be deprecated and is not activily being supported. 

You are free to use, modify and distribute this unsupported version. This tool is provided ‘as is’ with no warranties or guarantees.


# PowerShell Automated Lab Environment
This is an automated lab environment build tool to support authors, trainers, educators and students in designing and building a virtual lab environment.   

The configurations and control scripts for the Hyper-V virtual machine's are written in Microsoft PowerShell DSC and deployed using [VirtualEngine Lability](https://github.com/VirtualEngine/Lability). This tool will completely build a lab environment from scratch, however if you want to build your own environment and have the VMs configured for you, see the section on [StandAlone](./Standalone/README.md).

This tool is provided 'as is' with no warranties or guarantees.
