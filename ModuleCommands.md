# Module Commands

Most of the commands in the module use a domain-specific language (DSL), or a set of aliases, such as `Run-Lab,` to reference the actual commands (e.g. `Invoke-Runlab`). This DSL is intended to make it easier for beginner PowerShell users to use this module.

```powershell
Get-Command -module PSAutolab
```

Experienced PowerShell users are welcome to use the proper command names if they wish.
