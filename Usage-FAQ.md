*"I get an error about my network connection type being set to Public."*

### Full error:

```

### Fix:
```
# Find connections with a NetworkCategory set to Public
Get-NetConnectionProfile

# For each connection, change to Private or Domain
Set-NetConnectionProfile -InterfaceIndex 3 -NetworkCategory Private
```

Currently, Hyper-V only supports a single NAT network, you can read more about this here: 
https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/virtualization/2016/05/25/windows-nat-winnat-capabilities-and-limitations/.
Likely, if you receive the error above, you already have a NAT network created. 
For example, `Docker for Windows` creates a DockerNAT virtual switch and NAT network.
You can check if this is the case with the `Get-NetNat` PowerShell cmdlet. 
If you get back a NAT network object, then you won't be able to create another one for your lab.

The solution is to coordinate a single NAT network so it covers all of your NAT networking needs. 
- That likely means creating a larger NAT subnet that covers the IP ranges of all of your networks.
- Which also means coordinating IP ranges across apps so they can fall under a single NAT subnet. 
- Also, the NAT subnet cannot overlap with the external network that the host is attached to. So if a host is attached to 192.168.0.0/24, you can't use 192.168.0.0/16 as a NAT network.

Here's a visualization from the above limitations article:

Refer to this article for help on creating NAT networks: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/user_guide/setup_nat_network

Here are some helpful PowerShell commands

### List NAT networks, take note of the IP range and subnet
    Get-NetNat

### Remove an existing NAT network called DockerNAT
    Remove-NetNat DockerNAT

### Create a NAT network with coordinated subnet
    New-NetNat -Name DockerAndLabilityNAT -InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix "10.10.0.0/16"
    
Docker for Windows network settings can be updated from the windows tray icon. Lab network changes require updating both `Enable-Internet.ps1` and the `Lab.psd1` files.
