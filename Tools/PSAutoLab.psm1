Note: 
This module should not be considered to follow best practices. This is a collection of 'Control' scripts,
that use helping information that does not follow Advanced Function best practices.
This is intentional for the benefit and ease of use for students less familiar with PowerShell.
The goal was to make maintainence of the control scripts easier.
